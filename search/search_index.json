Most HDL IRs have a type for signed inputs and another for unsigned. LiveHD handles the superset (sign and unlimited precision) with a single node. In LGraph, an unsigned value is signed value that is always positive. This simplifies the mixing and conversions which simplifies the passes. The drawback is that the export may have to convert back to signed/unsigned for some languages like Verilog.</p> <p>Maybe even more important is that all the LGraph cell types generate the same result if the input is sign-extended. This has implications, for example a typical HDL IR type like \"concat\" does not exist because the result is dependent on the inputs size.

Each HDL may have different semantics, the Verilog is to showcase the specifics because it is a popular HDL.</p> <p>All the cell types are in <code>core/cell.hpp</code> and <code>core/cell.cpp</code>. The type enumerate is called <code>Ntype</code>. In general the nodes have a single output with the exception of complex nodes like subgraphs or memories. The inputs is a string in lower case or upper case. Upper case ('A') means that many edges (or output drivers) can connect to the same node input or sink pin, lower case ('a') means that only a driver can connect to the input or sink pin.</p> <p>Each cell type can be called directly with Pyrope using a low level RTL syntax. This is useful for debugging not for general use as it can result in less efficient LNAST code.</p> <p>An example of a multi-driver sink pin is the <code>Sum</code> cell which can do <code>Y=3+20+a0+a3</code> where <code>A_{0} = 3</code>, <code>A_{1} = 20</code>, <code>A_{2} = a0</code>, and <code>A_{3} = a3</code>. Another way to represent in valid Pyrope RTL syntax is:</p> <pre><code>Y = __sum(A=(3,20,a0,a3))\n</code></pre> <p>An example if single driver sink pin is the <code>SRA</code> cell which can do <code>Y=20&gt;&gt;3</code>. It is lower case because only one driver pin can connect to 'a' and 'b'. Another way to represent a valid Pyrope RTL syntax is:</p> <pre><code>Y = __sra(a=20,b=3)\n</code></pre> <p>The section includes description on how to compute the maximum (<code>max</code>) and minimum (<code>min</code>) allowed result range. This is used by the bitwidth inference pass. To ease the explanation, a <code>sign</code> value means that the result may be negative (<code>a.sign == a.min&lt;0</code>). <code>known</code> is true if the result sign is known (<code>a.known == a.max&lt;0 or a.min&gt;=0</code>), either positive or negative (<code>neg == a.max&lt;0</code>). The cells explanation also requires the to compute the bit mask (<code>a.mask == (1&lt;&lt;a.bits)-1</code>).</p> <p>For any value (<code>a</code>), the number of bits required (<code>bits</code>) is <code>a.bits = log2(absmax(a.max,a.min))+1</code>.</p>"},{"location":"livehd/05-lgraph/#sum","title":"Sum","text":"<p>Addition and substraction node is a single cell Ntype that performs 2-complement additions and substractions with unlimited precision.</p> graph LR     cell  --Y--&gt; c(fa:fa-spinner)     a(fa:fa-spinner) --A--&gt; cell[Sum]:::cell     b(fa:fa-spinner) --B--&gt; cell     classDef cell stroke-width:3px  <p>If the inputs do not have the same size, they are sign extended to all have the same length.</p> <p>Forward Propagation</p> <ul> <li>Value: <pre><code>%Y = A.reduce('+') - B.reduce('+')\n</code></pre></li> <li>Max/min: <pre><code>%max = 0\n%min = 0\nfor a in A {\n  %max += A.max\n  %min += A.min\n}\nfor b in B {\n  %max -= b.min\n  %min -= b.max\n}\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>Backward Propagation</p> <p>Backward propagation is possible when all the inputs but ONE are known.

For single-threaded code, there tends to be a main unified memory.</p> <p>Current CPUs follow a Von Neumann approach1. Languages designed to program CPUs have the same model to map existing hardware efficiently. Since the languages are Von Neumann, it is logical that CPUs also evolve to keep the same model and further improve the performance.

The difference is that the resources in hardware and software are not the same. In software, there are instructions; in hardware, there are cells2. This results in different optimization knobs.</p> <p>Designing an efficient software program is all about deciding the sequence of instructions to be small and fast. The computer architecture Iron's law summarizes it well. The performance is \"Instruction Count\" x \"Instructions Per Cycle\" x \"Frequency\". Since software programmers do not tend to consider the frequency, it is all about executing fewer instructions and doing each instruction as fast as possible. The software designer has to create a sequence of instructions to solve a problem. Those instructions could use resources like memory.</p> <p>Instead of instructions, most hardware designers have hardware blocks or cells like adders, multiplexors, flops, SRAMs... There are no central resources like memory, and they have to consider frequency.</p> <p>Like a software designer, the hardware designer needs to solve a problem. Still, instead of selecting a sequence of instructions, the designer selects the cells or hardware blocks and their interconnection. The designer divides problems into smaller pipeline stages to have a high frequency. A design with small cells that can achieve the desired frequency is an exemplary hardware design3. So it is all about instantiating blocks and connecting them.</p> <p>In hardware, there are two big categories of blocks: Combinational and Sequential. Combinational do not have a clock and perform operations like adding, and, xor... Sequential has a clock.  The clock is used to remember a value. Hence the output of a sequential block retains or memoizes the value of previous cycles while combinational blocks have no memory or clock concept.</p> <p>The hardware blocks are physical devices that need time to generate a valid output given a change in their inputs. When combinational blocks are connected, their maximum speed or frequency can be decided by finding the slowest path in the combinational blocks connected. This means that sequential blocks should separate combinational blocks to achieve higher frequency. This is called pipelining. There are overheads of adding more sequential blocks, and the hardware designer needs to find the correct balance given a set of constraints like area/frequency/power.</p> <p>A significant effort in hardware design goes to pipelining. Not only to find the correct spot separating combinational blocks but because the sequential block adds a concept of \"state\" or memory. Starting from a working combination lock and randomly adding some \"sequential\" blocks is highly likely to generate an incorrect result. Pipelining adds the conceptual problem that adding sequential blocks changes the semantics and that ALL the combinational blocks should have more or less the same frequency. Otherwise, the pipeline design is unbalanced4, and the slowest pipeline decides the overall frequency.</p> <p>The pipelining optimization concept is very different from software optimization.  In software, designers care about the average. If a function is slow and its execution requires half of the execution time, reducing by half should have a 25% performance improvement. The designer does not need to improve very infrequently used functions. In hardware, designers care about the worst case. If a pipeline stage is slow, improving it will result in a frequency improvement if it was the slowest. The benefit will be just the difference with the next slower pipeline stage, not optimizing the pipeline itself.</p> <p>The result is that hardware and software designers need to worry about different constraints like pipelining. Combined with the fact that hardware optimizations need to care about the worst case, not average, it is common for hardware designers to say that designing hardware is hard.</p>"},{"location":"pyrope/00-hwdesign/#hls-vs-hdl","title":"HLS vs. HDL","text":"<p>Hardware designers also use programming languages to specify their FPGA/ASIC design. In the past, designers \"drew\" the transistor/cells/gates and had a more visual layout to see/place where each combination and the sequential block was located. Although it is possible to do a design in such a way, it is not as productive as using some hardware design language.</p> <p>There are many popular software languages like C++, Java, Rust, swift... There are also several hardware design languages, but they tend to fall into two categories: HLS (High-Level Synthesis) or HDLs (Hardware Description Languages). HLS can be languages like a subset of C or Rust. The HDLs are languages like Verilog, CHISEL, or Pyrope.</p> <p>In a nutshell, HLS tries to leverage the larger Von Neumann community (languages and humans that know to program Von Neumann) and use compilers to transform to efficient hardware mappings that are not Von Neumann.</p> <p>HLS has to deal with constructs like loops and central memory. The typical solution for loops is to use heuristics and/or directives to split the loops into different pipeline stages. The standard solution for global memory is not to use it or put compiler directives to guide them. Other constructs like memory allocation and recursion are also avoided in HLS. When a C program is translated to hardware, if it has pointers and uses memory, it needs directives to indicate where the memory resides and mark potential overlap or pointer aliasing between pointers. Otherwise, the generated translation is likely to be inefficient.</p> <p>HDLs (Hardware Description Languages) do not have a Von Neumann model. The currently most popular HDL (Verilog) is a data flow language that does not have a global program counter like Von Neumann languages. Instead, the programmer specifies a hierarchy of modules5. In Verilog, the execution of each module has a complicated set of options, but from a high-level point of view, a group of statements is executed in each module. The module executes forever because it is a set of gates instantiated in the hardware design.</p>"},{"location":"pyrope/00-hwdesign/#hardware-artifacts","title":"Hardware artifacts","text":"<p>This section goes over several of the leading hardware artifacts that tend to be exist in most HDLs independent of the syntax.</p>"},{"location":"pyrope/00-hwdesign/#instantiation-vs-execution","title":"Instantiation vs execution","text":"<p>Hardware designers decide the gates are instantiated6 in the design, while software designers focus on executing the instructions. If a set of gates is rarely used, the hardware still has to instantiate them, and their performance area impact is independent of the usage frequency. In software, a set of seldom executed instructions have no performance impact. This is not the case in hardware. As such, languages build around \"instantiation\" more than traditional instruction execution.</p> <p>Instantiation means that the designer explicitly indicates the gates or circuits mapped to hardware. In the vast majority of HDLs (Verilog, CHISEl, pyRTL, VHDL...), the designer specifies a top-level module. Each module can have a set of gates and more instantiated sub-modules.</p> <p>In \"software,\" languages have a \"main\" or starting execution point. The \"main\" executes or calls several functions depending on the data. Functions can iterate in loops, and the program finishes execution when the main finishes.</p> <p>In contrast, most HDLs differ from software languages in that they specify an instantiation tree hierarchy of modules, and then provide some syntax on how each module executes independently of the other modules. </p> <p>In HDLs, the execution never ends, and the modules run independently. It resembles a bit of an actor model. An actor is a module with individual execution, but there are many differences like the tree structure of instantiations and the incapacity to spawn new actors. Although it is possible to build an HLS around the actor model without spawning capability, popular HDLs do not.</p> <p>In most HDLs, the instantiated tree hierarchy is fixed. This makes sense from a hardware point of view7, but this means that a module can not be called inside a control flow statement. A common mistake from designers learning HDLs is to call a module conditionally. E.g., this code sequence is not what a software programmer may expect:</p> Problematic codePossible solution <pre><code>var result = 0\nif some_opcode {\n  result = do_division(a,b)\n}else{\n  result = do_multiplication(a,b)\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>var result = 0\nvar result1 = do_division(a,b)\nvar result2 = do_multiplication(a,b)\nif some_opcode {\n  result = result1\n}else{\n  result = result2\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A software programmer thinks about executing instructions. The previous syntax looks like execute or call <code>do_division</code> when <code>some_opcode</code> is true, but it is impossible to do in most HDLs because they are centered around instantiation, not execution. For synthesizable code, none of the most popular HDLs like Verilog, VHDL, CHISEL, pyRTL allow the instantiation of a module in a conditional. Some like Verilog have <code>functions</code> but those are inlined.

Pyrope constrains the expressions so that no matter the evaluation order, the synthesis result is the same. </p> <p>As a reference, languages like C++11 do not have a defined order of evaluation for all types of expressions. Calling <code>call1() + call2()</code> is not defined. Either <code>call1()</code> first or <code>call2()</code> first.</p> <p>In many languages, the evaluation order is defined for logical expressions. This is typically called the short-circuit evaluation. Some languages like Pascal, Rust, Kotlin have different <code>and/or</code> to express conditional evaluation. In Pascal, there is an <code>and/or</code> and <code>and_then/or_else</code> (conditional). In Rust <code>&amp;/|</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;/||</code> (conditional). In Kotlin <code>&amp;&amp;/||</code> and <code>and/or</code> (conditional). Pyrope uses has the <code>and/or</code> without short-circuit, and the <code>and_then/or_else</code> with explicit short-circuit.</p> <p>The programmer can explicitly set an evaluation order by using short-circuit expressions like <code>and_then</code>, <code>or_else</code>, or control expressions (<code>if/else</code>, <code>match</code>, <code>for</code>). An expression can have many <code>function</code> calls because those have no side-effects, and hence the evaluation order is not important.</p> <p>A <code>procedure</code> is an lambda that can update state internally.

This means that in things like type check, if it may be OK but not possible to prove, the compiler can decide to insert an assert instead of forcing a code structure change.

The structural flop style is a legal Pyrope code using these type of names.</p> <p>In a more friendly Pyrope style, a register like <code>counter</code> starts with the <code>q</code> pin each cycle. The last value written to <code>counter</code> connects to the <code>din</code>. It is always possible to access the <code>q</code> pin/value directly with  pipeline directives <code>something#[0]</code>.</p> <p>If the register is accessed with the <code>-1</code> cycle (<code>#something#[-1]</code>), the flop will insert an additional pipeline to access 1 cycle before flop contents.</p> <p>It is also possible to use positive values (<code>variable#[3]</code>) which means the value in the future 3 cycles, but this is only allowed in debug statements like <code>assert</code> or <code>puts</code>.</p> <p>Latches are possible but with the direct RTL instantiation.

This helps the tool but more importantly the programmer because it helps to check assumptions about the function connections. The typical assignment <code>=</code> only connects combinational logic.</p> <p>The previous code connects two inputs (<code>in1</code>/<code>in2</code>) to a multiplier, and then connects the result of the multiplier to an adder.

It is covariant because adding the same extra fields to both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> keeps the semantics (<code>((foo=3,...x) does (foo=3,...y)) == x does y</code>).

The reason is shown in the previous example. The <code>fun(fd:fd_t)</code> can be called with <code>call_animal</code> because the fields accessed by <code>call_animal</code> are only a subset of <code>Dog</code> and hence if called inside <code>f_d</code> it can handle the <code>Dog</code> type. The opposite is not the case.</p> <p><code>:fun(x1)-&gt;(x2) does _:fun(y1)-&gt;y2</code> check is equivalent to <code>(y1 does x1) and (x2 does y2)</code>.</p> <p>Given a lambda passed as argument (<code>:fun(x:fun(c:c_t)-&gt;(d:d_t))-&gt;(y)</code>), the check when passing the lambda as argument to <code>x</code> a function like <code>fun(w:w_t)-&gt;(z:z_t)</code>. In this case, the <code>:fun(:w_t)-&gt;(_:z_t) does fun(:c_t)-&gt;(_:d_t)</code> is a contravariant test for inputs and covariant for outputs.

In programming languages this is called an invariance or bivariance.</p> <p>Pyrope uses the typical check in modern languages where the function arguments are contravariant and the return type is covariant.

If the intention is to intercept, the lambda must be added at the head of the tuple entry.</p> <pre><code>let base = (\n  ,fun1 = fun() { 1 }         // catch all\n  ,fun2 = fun() { 2 }         // catch all\n  ,fun3 = fun() { 3 }         // catch all\n)\nlet ext = base ++ (\n  ,fun1 =   fun (a,b){ 4 }  // overwrite allowed with extends\n  ,fun2 ++= fun (a,b){ 5 }  // append\n  ,fun2 ++= fun ()   { 6 }  // append\n  ,fun3 =   fun(a,b) { 7 } ++ base.fun3 // prepend\n  ,fun3 =   fun()    { 8 } ++ base.fun3 // prepend\n)\n\nvar t:ext = _\n\n// t.fun1 only has ext.fun1\nassert t.fun1(a=1,b=2) == 4\nt.fun1()                 // compile error, no option without arguments\n\n// t.fun2 has base.fun2 and then ext.fun2\nassert t.fun2(1,2) == 5  // EXACT match of arguments has higher priority\nassert t.fun2() == 2     // base.fun2 catches all ahead of ext.fun2\n\n// t.fun3 has ext.fun3 and then base.fun3\nassert t.fun3(1,2) == 7  // EXACT match of arguments has higher priority\nassert t.fun3() == 8     // ext.fun3 catches all ahead of ext.fun3\n</code></pre> <p>A more traditional \"overload\" calling the is possible by calling the lambda directly:</p> <pre><code>let x = base ++ (\n  ,fun1 = fun() { return base.fun1() + 100 }\n)\n</code></pre> <p>To allow overloading the base <code>lambda</code> as <code>var</code>. By concatenating lambdas to a variable, we effectively create an unnamed tuple with multiple entries. Since all the variables are tuples of size one too, the following rules apply to any lambda call:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Given a lambda call <code>f(a:a_t)-&gt;(_:r_t)</code> with defined call and return types.   Iterate and pick all the lambda definitions <code>f(x)-&gt;(y)</code> that satisfy <code>x does   a_t and y does r_t</code> using the previously explained lambda checks.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the <code>r_t</code> is unknown at call time, use only the call arguments <code>x does   a_t</code>. Check that all the matching lambdas have the same defined return type.   Otherwise a compile error is generated indicating that the type can not be   infered.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the list is empty, generate a compile error (no possible lambda to call).</p> </li> <li> <p>Once a list of ordered modules is found, evaluate the <code>where COND</code>. <code>COND</code>   can include inputs, self, and outputs. If a <code>COND</code> is comptime true (no   <code>COND</code> is the same as <code>true</code>), stop selecting additional modules. If <code>COND</code>   is comptime <code>false</code> remove from the list and continue. All the selected   modules will be executed, but the output will be selected based on priority   order based on the <code>COND</code> result at runtime.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the list has more than one entry, and any of them is a <code>proc</code>, generate a   compile error. Dynamic dispatch only works with functions <code>fun</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If the <code>where COND</code> is not compile time there must be a <code>where true</code> condition to catch the default behavior. </p> <p>The previous rules imply that Pyrope has some type of dynamic dispatch. The types for the inputs and outputs must be known at compile time (static dispatch) but the <code>where</code> condition may be known at run-time as long as the lambda is immutable (<code>fun</code>).</p> <p>The <code>where</code> condition is not considered part of the type system, but a syntax sugar to allow several function implementations depending on some condition. The alternative and equivalent syntax is to add all the <code>if/else</code> chain at every call but this result in not so maintanable code.</p> <pre><code>var fun_list = fun(a,b){ a+b}\nfun_list ++= fun(a,b,c){ a+b+c }\nfun_list ++= fun(a,b,c,d){ a+b+c+d }\n\nassert fun_list.[size] == 3    // 3 lambda entries in fun_list\n\nassert fun_list(1,2) == 3\nassert fun_list(1,2,4) == 7\nassert fun_list(1,2,4,5) == 12\nassert fun_list(1,2,4,5,6) == 18 // compile error, no function with 5 args\n\n\nfun_list ++= fun(a,b){ 100}\nassert fun_list(1,2) == 3\n\nfun_list = fun(a,b){ 200} ++ fun_list\nassert fun_list(1,2) == 200\n</code></pre> <p>For untyped named argument calls:</p> <pre><code>var f1 = fun(a,b){ a+b+100 }\n  f1 ++= fun(x,y){ x+y+200 }\n\nassert f1(a=1,b=2) == 103\nassert f1(x=1,y=2) == 203\nassert f1(  1,  2) == 103  // first in list\n</code></pre> <p>For typed calls:</p> <pre><code>var fo = fun(a:int,b:string)-&gt;(_:bool)  { true    }\n  fo ++= fun(a:int,b:int   )-&gt;(_:bool)  { false   }\n  fo ++= fun(a:int,b:int   )-&gt;(_:string){ \"hello\" }\n\nlet a = fo(3,hello)\nassert a == true\n\nlet b = fo(3,300)        // first in list return bool\nassert b == false\n\nlet c:int = fo(3,300)    // compile error, no lambda fulfills constrains\nlet c:string = fo(3,300)\nassert c == \"hello\"\n</code></pre> <p>For conditional argument calls:</p> <pre><code>var f1 = fun(a,b)      where a &gt;  40 { b+100    }\n      ++ fun(a,b)-&gt;(x) where x &gt; 300 { b+200    } // output x\n      ++ fun(a,b)-&gt;(a) where a &gt;  20 { b+300    } // input a\n      ++ fun(a,b)-&gt;(x) where x &gt;  10 { b+400    } // output x\n      ++ fun(a,b)                    { a+b+1000 } // default\n\nvar fun_manual = fun(a,b){  // equivalent but not as maintenable\n  if a&gt;40 {\n    return b+100\n  }\n  let x = b + 200\n  if x&gt;300 {\n    return (x=x)\n  }\n  if a&gt;20 {\n    return b+300\n  }\n  let tmp = a + b\n  if tmp &gt;10 {\n    return (a=tmp)\n  }\n  return a+b+1000\n}\n\ntest \"check equiv\" {\n  for a in -100..=100 {\n    for b in -100..=100 {\n      assert f1(a,b) == fun_manual(a,b)\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"pyrope/07b-structtype/#parametric-polymorphism","title":"Parametric polymorphism","text":"<p>Add-hoc polymorphism overloads a function, and parametric polymorphism allows to  parametrize types based on arguments.</p> <pre><code>let Param_type = fun(a) { return (xx:a = _) }\n\nlet x:Param_type(string) = (xx=\"hello\")\nlet x:Param_type(int)    = (xx=130)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"pyrope/07b-structtype/#summary-polymorphism","title":"Summary polymorphism","text":"<p>Subtype polymorphism: A subtype provides functionality/api for another super type. <pre><code>let Animal = (\n  ,speak:fun(self) = _\n)\nlet Cat: Animal = (\n  ,speak = fun(self) { puts \"meaow\" }\n)\nlet Bird: Animal = (\n  ,speak = fun(self) { puts \"pio pio\" }\n)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Parametric polymorphism: Same function works for many types <pre><code>let smallest = fun(...a) {\n  let x = a[0]\n  for i in a[1..] {\n    x = i when i &lt; x\n  }\n  return x\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Ad-hoc polymorphism: capacity to overload the same lambda name with different types. <pre><code>let speak = fun(a:Bird) { puts \"pio pio\"  } \n         ++ fun(a:Cat) { puts \"meaow\" }\n</code></pre></p> <p>Coercion polymorphism: Capacity to cast a type to another <pre><code>let Type1 = (\n  ,setter = fun(ref self, a:int) {  }\n)\nlet a:Type1 = 33\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"pyrope/07b-structtype/#traits-and-mixin","title":"Traits and mixin","text":"<p>There is no object inheritance in Pyrope, but tuples allow to build mixin and composition.</p> <p>A mixin is when an object or class can add methods and the parent object can access them.

If two tuples have the same field a tuple, the concatenated operator (<code>++</code>) will create an entry with two or more sub-entries. This is likely an error with basic types but useful to handle explicit method overload.</p> <p>In a way, the concatenate just adds methods from two tuples to create a new tuple. In programming languages with object-oriented programming (OOP), there are many keywords (<code>virtual</code>, <code>final</code>, <code>override</code>, <code>static</code>...) to constrain how methods can be updated/changed. In Pyrope, the <code>let</code> and <code>var</code> keywords can be added to any tuple field. The <code>let</code> makes the entry immutable when applied to a method, it behaves like a <code>final</code> keyword in most languages.</p> <p>There are also two ways to concatenate tuples in Pyrope. <code>t1 ++ t2</code> and <code>(...t1, ...t2)</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>t1 ++ t2</code> concatenates each field in both tuples. A compile error is   generated if <code>t1</code> field is a <code>let</code> with a defined value, and <code>t2</code> has also   the same defined field.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>(...t1, ...t2)</code> inserts in-place, triggers a compile error if the same   public field appears in both tuples and it is defined in both. <code>private</code>   fields are privatized and hence do not trigger overload failure.</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>let Int1 = (\n  ,var counter:int:[private] = 0\n  ,add = proc(ref self, v) { self.counter += v }\n  ,get = fun(self) -&gt; (_:int) { self.counter }\n  ,api_pending: proc(ref self, x:int) -&gt; (o:string) = _\n)\n\nlet Int2 = (\n  ,var counter:int:[private] = 0\n  ,accumulate = proc(ref self, v) { self.counter += v ; return self.counter }\n  ,api_pending:proc(ref self, x:string) -&gt; (o:string) = _\n)\n\nlet Combined = (...Int1, ...Int2\n  ,api_pending = proc(ref self, x:int) -&gt; (o:string) {\n    self.add(x)\n    string(self.accumulate(self.get()))\n  }\n)\n</code></pre> <p>It is also important to notice that when one of the tuples as an entry, it can have an undefined value (<code>nil</code> or <code>0sb?</code>).  If the entry value is undefined, neither concatenate (<code>++</code>) or in-place insert (<code>...</code>) trigger a compile error. This is quite useful for defining interfaces because the default value for a function is <code>nil</code>.</p> <pre><code>let Interface = (\n  ,let add:fun(ref self, x) = _ // nil or undefined method\n  ,let sub = fun(ref self,x ) { self.add(-x) }\n)\n\nInterface.add(3)                // compile error, undefined method\n\nlet My_obj = (\n  ,val1:u8 = 0\n  ,let add = fun(ref self, x) { self.val += x }\n) ++ Interface                  // OK, but not recommended\n\nlet My_obj2 = (\n  ,...Interface                 // recommended\n  ,val1:u8 = 0\n  ,let add = fun(ref self, x) { self.val += x }\n)\ncassert My_obj equals My_obj2   // same behavioir no defined overlap fiels\n\nlet xx:My_obj = _               // default initialization\n\ncassert xx.val1 == 0\nxx.add(3)\ncassert xx.val1 == 3\nxx.sub(2)\ncassert xx.val1 == 1\n</code></pre> <p>Pyrope does not directly check that all the undefined methods are implemented, but this will trigger a compile error whenever the undefined method is used. This is different from most static type languages, but a bit closer to dynamically typed languages. The difference is that the check is at compile time, but an error happens ONLY if the method is used anywhere in the instantiated project.</p> <p>To build tuples that implement the functionality of other tuples, the recommended technique is to use the in-place operator. It checks that there is no defined overlap between both tuples.</p> <p>An issue with in-place operator is when more than one tuple has the <code>setter</code> method. If the tuples are concatenated with <code>...</code> and error is triggered, if the tuples are concatenated with <code>++</code> it does not check if methods overlap.

Compatible does not mean that it will generate the same <code>?</code> bits as Verilog, but that it will not generate an unknown when Verilog has known. It is allowed to generate a <code>0</code> or a <code>1</code> when the Verilog logical equivalence check generates an <code>?</code>.</p> <p>The previous definition of compatibility could allow the Pyrope compiler to randomly replace all the unknowns by <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> when doing internal compiler passes. It could even replace all the unknowns with <code>0</code> all the time, or even pick the representation that generates the most efficient code.</p> <p>The issue is that the most likely source of having unknowns in operations is either during reset or due to a bug on how to handle non initialized structures like memories.</p> <p>The compiler internal transformations use a 3-state logic that includes <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>?</code> for each bit. Any register or memory initialized with unknowns will generate a Verilog with the same initialization.</p> <p>The compiler internals only needs to deal with unknowns during the copy propagation or peephole optimizations. The compile goes through 2 phases: LNAST and Lgraph.</p> <p>In the compiler passes, we have the following semantics:</p> <ul> <li> <p>In Pyrope, there are 3 array-like structures: non-persistent arrays, register   arrays, and custom RTL memories. Verilog and CHISEL memories get translated   to custom RTL memories. Non-persistent Verilog/CHISEL get translated to arrays.   In Verilog, the semantics is that an out of bounds access generates unknowns. In   CHISEL, the <code>Vec</code> sematic is that an out of bound access uses the first index   of the array. A CHISEL out of bound memory is an unknown like in Verilog. These   are the semantics applied by the compiler optimization/transformations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Custom RTL memories do not allow value propagation across the array, only   across non-persistent arrays, or register arrays explicitly marked with   <code>retime=true</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>An out of bound RTL address drops the unused index bits. For non-power of   two arrays, out of bounds access triggers a compile error. The code must   be fixed to avoid access. An <code>if addr &lt; mem_size { ... mem[addr] ... }</code>   tends to be enough. This is to guarantee that passes like Verilog and   CHISEL have the same semantics, and trigger likely bugs in Pyrope code.</p> </li> <li> <p>An index with unknowns does not perform value propagation.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Shifts, additions and substractions propagate unknowns at computation. E.g:   <code>0b11?0 + 0b1</code> is <code>0b11?1</code>, <code>0b1?0 &gt;&gt; 1</code> is <code>0b1?</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other arithmetic are more conservative. When an input is unknown, the result   is unknown only respecting the sign when possible. E.g: <code>0b1?0? * -1</code> is   <code>0sb1?</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Logic operations behave like Verilog. <code>0b000111??? | 0b01?01?01?</code> is   <code>0b01?111?1?</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Equality comparisons (<code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>) use unknowns, this means that at compile   time <code>0b1? != 0b10</code>. Comparisons is consistent with the equivalent logic   operations <code>a == b</code> is the same as <code>(a ^ b) == -1</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other comparisons (<code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>) return true if the comparison is   true for each possible unknown bit.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>match</code> statement and <code>unique if</code> will trigger a compile error if the unknown   semantics during compiler passes can trigger 2 options simultaneously. The   solution is to change to a sequence of <code>ifs</code> or change the code to guarantee   no unknowns.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>if</code> statement without <code>unique</code> logical expressions that have an unknown   (single bit) are a source of confusion. In Verilog, it depends on the   compiler options. A classic compiler will generate <code>?</code> in all the updated   variables.  A Tmerge option will propagate <code>?</code> only if both sides can   generate a different value. The LNAST optimization pass will behave like the   Tmerge when the if/mux control has unknowns:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If all the paths have the same constant value, the <code>if</code> is useless and   the correct value will be used. </p> </li> <li> <p>If any path has a different constant value, the generated result bits will   have unknowns if the source bits are different or unknown. </p> </li> <li> <p>If any paths are not constant, there is no LNAST optimization. Further   Lgraph optimizations could optimize if all the mux generated values are   proved to be the same.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The <code>for</code> loops are expanded, if the expression in the <code>for</code> is unknown, a   compile error is generated.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>while</code> loops are also expanded, if the condition on the <code>while</code> loop has   unknowns a compile error is generated.</p> </li> </ul> <p>At the end of the LNAST generation, a Lgraph is created. Only the registers and memory initialization are allowed to have unknowns in Lgraph.  Any invalid (<code>nil</code>) to an outout or register triggers a compile error. Any unknown constant bit is translated to zero (<code>0b10?</code> becomes <code>0b100</code>). LGraph does not have \"unknowns\" outside the register/memories.</p> <p>As a result of these translations, the generated simulator may have to deal with unknowns, but only for arrays and memories explicitly non initialized contents.
