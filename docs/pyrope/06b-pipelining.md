# Pipelining

One of the fundamental differences between most programming languages and hardware description languages is that pipelining is a
fundamental feature that must be used in hardware but not in software designs.

To illustrate the confusion/complication the following example illustrates a multiplier that takes 3 cycles and an adder that
takes 1 cycle to complete, and the conceptual problems of integrating them:

```
|(in1,in2) -> (out)|

add1 = {|a,b| // 1 cycle add
  #reg = a+b
  return #reg
}
mul3 = {|a,b| // 3 cycle multiply
  #reg1 = $a * $b
  #reg2 = #reg1
  #reg3 = #reg2
  return #reg3
}

x    =# mul3(in1, in2)
%out =# add1(x,in3)
```

The first observation is the new assignment `=#` instead of `=`. This is to explicitly indicate to Pyrope that the function called
(`mul3`, `add1`) can have pipeline outputs. This helps the tool but more importantly the programmer because it helps to check
assumptions about the function connections. The typical assignment `=` only connects combinational logic.

The previous code connects two inputs (in1/in2) to a multiplier, and then connects the result of the multiplier to an adder. The
`in1` inputs is also passed to the adder. This results in the following functionality:

``` mermaid
graph LR
    in1[in1] --a--> m0(mul3 cycle 0)
    in2[in2] --b--> m0

    m0 --> m1(mul3 cycle 1)
    m1 --> m2(mul3 cycle 2)
    
    in1--a--> a0[add1 cycle 1]
    m2 --b--> a0
    a0 --> out[out]
```


The issue in most HDLs is that the connection is unaware of the pipelining, and it is left up to the programmer to understand and
check the potential pipeline stages inside `add1` and `mul3`. This lack of pipelining awareness in the language syntax is common
in most HDLs.

In Pyrope, the `=#` must be used when there is any path that starting from the inputs of the function passes through a pipeline
stage to generate the assignment. If all the paths have exactly 1 flop in between, it is a 1 stage pipeline, if some paths have 2
flops and others 3, it is a 2 or 3 pipeline stages. Sometimes, there are loops, and the tool has 1 to infinite pipeline stages.


The default pipeline assignment `=#` just checks that it is possible to have pipeline stages between the module/function inputs
and the assignment value. To restrict the check, it accepts a range. E.g: `=#[3]` means that there are exactly 3 flops or cycles
between inputs and the assignment. `=#[0..<4]` means that there are between 0 and 3 cycles, and open range could be used when
there are loops (E.g: `=#[2..]`).

```
let x = mul3(in1, in2)      // compile error: 'mul3' is pipelined
let x =# mul3(in1, in2)     // OK
%out  =# add1(x,in3)        // OK (in3 has 0 cycles, x has 3 cycles)
%out  =#[1] add1(x,in3)     // compile error: 'x' is pipelined with '3' cycles
%out  =#[3] add1(x,in3)     // compile error: 'in3' is pipelined with '1' cycle
%out  =#[1..<4] add1(x,in3) // OK
```

The previous code will check the assumptions in pipelining. It is likely that the designer wanted to implement a multiply-add.  As
such, the input to the adder should be from the same cycle as the multiplied started to operate. Otherwise, values across cycles
are mixed. 

``` mermaid
graph LR
    in1[in1] --a--> m0(mul3 cycle 0)
    in2[in2] --b--> m0

    m0 --> m1(mul3 cycle 1)
    m1 --> m2(mul3 cycle 2)
    
    in1  --> in1_0(flop cycle 0)
    in1_0--> in1_1(flop cycle 1)
    in1_1--> in1_2(flop cycle 2)
    in1_2--a--> a0[add1 cycle 0]
    m2 --b--> a0
    a0 --> out[out]
```

It is possible to balance the pipeline stages explicitly, the issue is that it is error prone because it requires to know exactly
the number of cycles for `mul3`. This is were the `repipe` command becomes handy, it guarantees that all the paths from the inputs
to every tuple entry has exactly the same pipeline depth. It does it by adding pipeline stages as needed. If it can not be done
automatically like when there are loops, an error is generated and an explicit solution should be used.

=== "Explicitly added pipeline stages"

    ```
    x =# mul3(in1, in2)
    y = in1#[-3]
    %out =# add1(a=x,b=y)  // connect in1 from -3 cycles
    ```

=== "repipe statement"

    ```
    x =# mul3(in1, in2)
    z = repipe  (a=x,b=in1)  // add flops to match x and in1
    %out =# add1(z))  

    assert z.a == x // x is not repipelined
    assert z.b == in1#[-3]
    ```

The |> keyword (`|>`) connects functions, but guarantees that all the outputs have the same delay from the inputs. Effectively,
it adds a `repipe` command.

=== "With |>"

    ```
    (a=mul3(in1, in2), b=in1) |> add |> %out   // pipelined add.b input



    (a=mul3(in1, in2)) |> add(b=in1)           // non-pipelined add.b input
    ```

=== "With repipe"

    ```
    let x =# repipe (a=mul3(in1, in2), b=in1)  // pipelined add.b input
    %out  =# add(x)

    let x =# mul3(in1, in2)
    %out  =# add(a=x, b=in1)                   // non-pipelined add.b input
    ```

=== "With explicit"

    ```
    let x =# mul3(in1, in2)                    // pipelined add.b input
    %out  =# add(a=x,b=in#[-3])

    let x =# mul3(in1, in2)
    %out  =# add(a=x, b=in1)                   // non-pipelined add.b input
    ```

The `repipe` command arguments can add and remove pipeline stages. The default setting is to add pipeline stages to match, but
those are future options:

```
z = repipe (a=x,b=in1) to x  // same as a=x,b=in#[-3]
z = repipe (a=x,b=in1) to 5  // same as a=x#[-2],b=in#[-5]
z = repipe (a=x,b=in1) to 0  // try to create a combinational path
z = repipe (x        ) to 2  // repipeline mul3 to have 2 stages
```

## Future improvements

Pipelining is one of the concepts that add extra complexity to HDLs, and it is a research topic what is the best approach, as such this section
summarizes a couple of potential paths for future Pyrope development.


### Liam constructs

In most HDLs loops have to be compile time unrolled, in earlier version of
Pyrope[^liam] allowed for extra keywords to create an actor model and create
state machines were each loop iteration will be executed in a cycle.


```
while some_condition) {

  step   // next cycle starts here
}
```

Fluid constructs:

* `variable?` check if `variable` valid bit is set
* `variable!` check if `variable` has a fluid backpressure
* `keep` do not consume variable on use
* `step` stop the cycle here, continue next cycle after the yield statement
